# Democratic-RPSO
Multi-robot SLAM using Democratic robotic particle swarm optimization Democratic PSO is a pso variety algorithm, which allows the participation of all the particles while selecting the global best solution. The algorithme is developped in algDemocraticRPSO.m file and tested in Multi-robot SLAM problem using the MRSim platform (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38409-mrsim-multi-robot-simulator--v1-0- for more information about the MRSim). Simulation results have been compared with other algorithms in Result and comparison's excel files. You can find more details about the Democratic RPSO in the paper's first draft https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01327367/document
